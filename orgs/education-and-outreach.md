These organizations are focused on sharing the knowledge of CS and tech to various communities within or beyond UCLA! If you like community service and teaching, these are the organizations for you!

## [ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com/)

[ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com/) is a K-12 outreach club dedicated to providing equitable access to CS education in the LA Area! We teach classes, run events, and write code so that everybody gets to enjoy CS. And importantly, we want to help you grow: as a student, a teacher, a programmer, a leader, and as a person!

**Skills you will use/learn:**

Through teaching and curriculum development, you’ll practice your teaching and public speaking skills, learn more about all the different areas of computer science, and be a role model for kids all over LA!

There are also opportunities to practice software development as part of our dev team: you’ll become a pro web developer, using the basic building blocks of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and a variety of libraries (React, Redux, Firebase, d3, etc.) to make some awesome websites!

**Beginner friendly?**

We love beginners, newcomers, and people from diverse backgrounds. We don’t care what major you are, if you know how to code, or if you’ve worked with kids before; we can teach you everything you’ll need to know for your first day! Our breadth gives you opportunities to learn all sorts of skills, from CS fundamentals to hands-on project experience, or soft skills like public speaking and leadership. And, we especially value diversity as it brings so much to the classroom, both in how we think about teaching and as role models for kids. Long story short, you’re pretty cool, and we probably want you!
